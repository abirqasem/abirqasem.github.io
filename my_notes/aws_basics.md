# AWS (mostly for AWS Cloud 9 IDE)


#### Important information you need to know before log in
0. You are logging into an IAM account. Not your Amazon account. The IAM has been created for you.
2. You account alias is: `teamli60`
2. `abir` and `tanya` are the users

### [Console]( https://teamli60.signin.aws.amazon.com/console)

Once you are logged in you can navigate to cloud 9 IDE by exploring the services and choosing `cloud 9`
You can also go directly to a cloud 9 that is created for us.
### Here it is [cafe machine](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/shared)
>*Remember* you will need to enter three pieces of information. First it will ask for account id or alias, enter `teamli60`, then `tanya` and the usual password. You will be all set. 

You can make your [own machine and ide](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/create)

+ You need to create an EC2 instance and then _connect_ cloud 9 service to it.
+ One EC2 is same as a single machine in clould 9, but it is more powerful (of course)

### Some notes:

1. We need to migrate to AWS cloud 9. The sooner the better.
1. We can get familiar with AWS by using cloud 9 and then experimenting with Alexa and other stuff.
1. Two types of logins. IAM - most of the time, root in special cases.
1. The root account is used for billing etc.
