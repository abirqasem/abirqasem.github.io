IBM Cloud Platform (mostly for Watson services)

Vocabulary, organization and starting point
Bluemix and IBM cloud are the same thing.
Inorder to use a service you create a resource (there are other type of resources that we will not worry about for now)
Credendtials are associated with services (https://console.bluemix.net/docs/resources/acct_resources.html#resource)
username/password credentials are very useful. They will be created by default if available.
