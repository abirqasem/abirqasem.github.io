# IBM Cloud Platform (mostly for Watson services)

### Vocabulary, organization and starting point
1. Bluemix and IBM cloud are the same thing.
2. In order to use a service you create a resource (there are other type of resources that we will not worry about for now)
3. [Credentials are associated with services](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/resources/acct_resources.html#resource)
4. username/password credentials are very useful. They will be created by default if available.
